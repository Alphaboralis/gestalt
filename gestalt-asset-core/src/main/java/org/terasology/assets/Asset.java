/**
 * Abstract base class common to all assets.
 * <p>
 * An asset is a resource that is used by the game - a texture, sound, block definition and the like. These are typically
 * loaded from a module, although they can also be created at runtime. Each asset is identified by a ResourceUrn that uniquely
 * identifies it and can be used to obtain it. This urn provides a lightweight way to serialize a reference to an Asset.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Assets are created from a specific type of asset data. There may be a multiple implementations with a common base for a particular type of asset data
 * - this allows for implementation specific assets (e.g. OpenGL vs DirectX textures for example might have an OpenGLTexture and DirectXTexture implementing class
 * respectively, with a common Texture base class).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Assets may be reloaded by providing a new batch of data, or disposed to free resources - disposed assets may no
 * longer be used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To support making Asset implementations thread safe reloading, creating an instance and disposal are all synchronized.
 * Implementations should consider thread safety around any methods they add if it is intended for assets to be used across multiple threads.
 * </p>
